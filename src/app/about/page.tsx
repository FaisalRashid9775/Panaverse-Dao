                The internet is without a doubt the most important technological
                development in human history. Web3 and metaverse technologies
                expand the internet as we know it by introducing novel features
                and advancements. Metaverse will make use of all aspects of
                modern technology, including 3D, VR, AR, AI, blockchain, cloud
                computing, voice computing, ambient computing, and more.
